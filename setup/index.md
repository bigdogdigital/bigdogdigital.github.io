[<< Home](/) 

1. Ensure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) installed. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a also good idea as you will need to use packages in many projects, but it's not required for the base version.
2. Download and Install [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/)
3. [Connect Local to WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/support/local/#Enable_WPE_API_and_Generate_Credentials)
